# golf-leaderboard
Display the leaderboard of the current week's PGA tournament in your terminal.

This project was mostly an excuse to demonstrate the use of [table-scraper](https://github.com/maxthyen/table-scraper) 
and experiment with [blessed](https://github.com/chjj/blessed) and [blessed-contrb](https://github.com/yaronn/blessed-contrib).
